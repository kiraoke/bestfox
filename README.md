# Best user.js(according to me)

- Combo of arkenfox + betterfox + smoothfox
- Doesn't clear history, cookies and sessions on close(modified from arkenfox), as it's annoying for most users(including me).
- Modifies zen browser's url bar to my liking
- Also has my userChrome.css which removes max, min from titlebar

## Installation

open  `about:support` in firefox or firefox based browser.
go to your profile directory
add user.js
create a folder `chrome`
add userChrome.css in `chrome/userChrome.css`
go to `about:support`
click on `clear startup cache` at top and restart browser.

### Enjoy bestfox
